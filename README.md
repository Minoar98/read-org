## 🧩 Challenges Faced

### 💬 Comments UI

Designing the comment section to look clean and structured while keeping it readable on dark backgrounds was a challenge.  
Creating nested reply threads with borders, avatar alignment, and responsive text spacing required careful layout testing.

### 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

Ensuring a smooth layout for mobile devices was tricky — particularly with the image slider and manga grid system.  
Bootstrap’s grid helped, but custom CSS was added to improve spacing, image resizing, and stacking behavior for smaller screens.

### 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Throughout this project, I learned several valuable lessons:

- The importance of responsive design planning from the start — especially when working with complex grids and sliders.

- How to balance Bootstrap’s defaults with custom CSS for a unique visual identity.

- Techniques for improving UI readability on dark themes, including color contrast and typography choices.

- Structuring HTML and CSS in a modular and scalable way for easier maintenance.

## Understanding how user experience (UX) improves when small details like padding, hover effects, and font sizes are consistent across devices
